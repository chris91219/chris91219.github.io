I’m currently pursuing a PhD in **Mechanical and Industrial Engineering** at the **University of Toronto**, advised by **Prof. Scott Sanner** and **Prof. Elias Khalil**. I earned my **Bachelors in Computer Science (Honours)** from the **University of Waterloo**.

My research interests center on **reasoning**, with a current focus on **Neural Program Synthesis**—building learning-based systems that can induce and compose programs to solve structured, algorithmic tasks.
